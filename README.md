# Connecting HADash to Your Home Assistant

Follow these steps to connect the HADash app to your Home Assistant instance:

### 1. Create an API Key
To create an API key:

- Go to your Home Assistant web interface.
- Click on your **user profile** (bottom left corner).
- Scroll down to the **Long-Lived Access Tokens** section.
- Click **Create Token**, and give it any name (e.g., `hadash-key`).
- After clicking "OK", you'll see your API key. **Copy it immediately**, as it will not be shown again after closing the window.
